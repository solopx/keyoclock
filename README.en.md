# Key O'Clock

Key O'Clock is your command center for software asset and license management. No more lost Excel spreadsheets, sticky notes on the monitor, or that wonderfull meetings with the management board when a critical application stops your company because someone forgot to renew the contract.

## Why use it?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Full Visibility** | Know exactly what you have, where it is, and what it costs. |
| **Zero Surprises** | Visual and email alerts that warn you well before deadlines hit. |
| **Executive Reporting** | Export board-ready data in seconds. |

## What it does for you

### Smart Inventory
Organize everything in a tree structure **(Group → List → Item)**. As intuitive as a file folder, but with the power of a database. Accidentally deleted something? Soft delete keeps your data in "quarantine" before it's gone for good.

### Health Traffic Light (Automatic Status)
The system works for you, classifying your licenses in real time:

| | |
|---|---|
| 🟣 **Expired** | You have a problem. |
| 🔴 **Critical** (≤30 days) | Time to open the procurement process. |
| 🟠 **Attention / Soon** (≤60 days) | On your radar, no rush yet. |
| 🟢 **Valid / Perpetual**  (>90 days)| Sleep easy. |

### Executive Dashboard & Stylish Widgets
It's not just functional — it's good-looking. Track your license portfolio health with clear charts and our famous and patented  **Next Expiration Widget**.

Pick your style: From the classic **Odometer** to the retro **Digital**, or even an **Hourglass** for the dapper ones. 9 styles in total.

### The "Virtual Assistant" That Never Sleeps
Key O'Clock sends automated reports and alerts straight to your inbox:

- **Scheduled Reports** — A full PDF in your email every X days.
- **Daily E-mails** — "Hey, these 3 licenses go critical today."
- **Expiration Reminders** — So you don't forget to clean up what's already past.

## Security & Privacy

Key O'Clock uses **Fernet (AES-128 + HMAC-SHA256)** to protect sensitive fields like contracts and SMTP passwords. The key is configured under **Settings → Database → Encryption**.

> **⚠ Responsibility notice:**
> The encryption key belongs to **you**. If you lose it, not even NSA can recover the data.
> Guard your `.enc_key` file like gold — and always back it up alongside `keyoclock.db`.

---

## Make It Yours

Every user has their own taste. That's why we offer:

- **7 Themes** — including the nostalgic Windows XP and the sleek Midnight.
- **9 Widget Styles** — Ring, Arc, Bar, Minimal, Digital, Classic, Hourglass, Odometer, Flip.

| `HTTPS_MODE` | unset | Enables HTTPS mode with cheroot + TLS |
| `PORT` | `5000` | Server port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Listening interface |
| `DISABLE_SCHEDULER` | unset | `'1'` disables APScheduler (required with gunicorn `-w N`) |

export KEYOCLOCK_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/keyoclock
export HTTPS_MODE=1
python app.py
```
